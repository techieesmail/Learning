Example 1 - First Quartz Program	Think of this as a "Hello World" for Quartz
Example 2 - Simple Triggers	Shows a dozen different ways of using Simple Triggers to schedule your jobs
Example 3 - Cron Triggers	Shows how Cron Triggers can be used to schedule your job
Example 4 - Job State and Parameters	Demonstrates how parameters can be passed into jobs and how jobs maintain state
Example 5 - Handling Job Misfires	Sometimes job will not execute when they are supposed to. See how to handle these Misfires
Example 6 - Dealing with Job Exceptions	No job is perfect. See how you can let the scheduler know how to deal with exceptions that are thrown by your job
Example 7 - Interrupting Jobs	Shows how the scheduler can interrupt your jobs and how to code your jobs to deal with interruptions
Example 8 - Fun with Calendars	Demonstrates how a Holiday calendar can be used to exclude execution of jobs on a holiday
Example 9 - Job Listeners	Use job listeners to have one job trigger another job, building a simple workflow
Example 10 - Using Quartz Plug-Ins	Demonstrates the use of the XML Job Initialization plug-in as well as the History Logging plug-ins
Example 11 - Quartz Under High Load	Quartz can run a lot of jobs but see how thread pools can limit how many jobs can execute simultaneously
Example 12 - Remote Job Scheduling using RMI	Using Remote Method Invocation, a Quartz scheduler can be remotely scheduled by a client
Example 13 - Clustered Quartz	Demonstrates how Quartz can be used in a clustered environment and how Quartz can use the database to persist scheduling information
Example 14 - Trigger Priorities	Demonstrates how Trigger priorities can be used to manage firing order for Triggers with the same fire time
Example 15 - TC Clustered Quartz	Demonstrates how Quartz can be clustered with Terracotta, rather than with a database
